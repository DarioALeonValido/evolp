The present directory corresponds with the work done in
paper arXiv:1605.09697.


There are two scripts: 'ltee.py', for LTEE data, and 
'cnv_europeans.py', for European ancestry CNV data.

'ltee.py' reads data on SPM and SNP that is measured 
during the LTEE experiment and can be found in papers
https://doi.org/10.1101/sqb.2009.74.018
https://doi.org/10.1128/mBio.01377-14 

while 'cnv_europeans.py' reads CNV data found in paper
https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-13624-1


Outputs of 'ltee.py':
- a data file with an estimate for the total number of 
  SPM in the LTEE.
- 2 figures on the time evolution of the number of SPM.
- a figure on the time evolution of the number of fixed LR.
- a figure on the size distribution of LR.

Outputs of 'cnv_europeans.py':
- a figure on the size distribution of the CNV data.
