Processing and Analyzing Mutations and Gene Expression Data in Different Systems.

The present repository is developed within the project directed by 
Prof. Augusto Gonzalez from the Institute of Cybernetics, 
Mathematics and Physics, Havana, Cuba. It is aimed at collecting 
computational tools and data, that hopefully are useful to study 
mutations and gene expression signatures in different systems.

The repository is released under a GPL version 3 license as 
stated in the LICENSE file.

The repository is organized in different folders that correspond
to several works carried out or being carried on in the group.
We specify the reference articles, either by the group or
by external authors.
