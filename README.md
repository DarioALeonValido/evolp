# evol_p
Data Processing, Modeling and Simulation of Evolutionary Phenomena.

The present repository is develop within the project directed by 
Prof. Augusto Gonzalez from the Institute of Cybernetics, 
Mathematics and Physics, Havana, Cuba. It is aimed at collecting 
computational tools and data, that hopefully are useful to study 
evolutionary phenomena and to analyze available experimental data.

The repository is released under a GPL version 3 license as 
stated in the LICENSE file.

The repository is organized in different folders that correspond
with several works carried out or being carried out in the group.
We specify the reference articles, either within the group or
from external sources.
