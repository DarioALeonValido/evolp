Inside the current directory we store the collection of data that 
we may want to use from TCGA databases. 

The 'sample' files are already included in our repository and
describe the list of txt files that 'data' folders should contain.

In order for the repository scripts to work without having to make 
any modification to them, it is necessary that the files be 
downloaded directly into each folder, without making any kind of 
subdirectory or modification in the names.

The 'KIRC' data is already included in its corresponding folder 
in two compressed files with tar.xz format. This is the default 
example used to illustrate the PCA technique. Nevertheless, the
data need to be uncompressed before running the script without
making any subdirectory, as mentioned before.

The rest of the examples can be downloaded directly from the TCGA 
website by following the specific link that is found within each
'data' folder. One possible way to get the files is to add them all
to the cart, go to the cart and click the download button. Note 
that the Sample Sheets are also available, they must match those 
already provided in our repository. Again, be sure to use the 
correct paths and names.
