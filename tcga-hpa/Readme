This directory corresponds to the Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
of gene expression data that come from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
and Human Protein Atlas (HPA).

There are two python script 'tcga.py', for TCGA data, and 'hpa.py',
for HPA data.

'tcga.py' reads TCGA data found in the 'databases_generated/tcga-hpa/'
directory at the repository root and applies the PCA technique.

'hpa.py' reads HPA data found in the 'databases_external/tcga-hpa/'
directory at the repository root and applies the PCA technique.

Output of 'tcga.py':
- a figure corresponding to a three-dimensional graph of the TCGA data
  represented in the first three principal components.

Outputs of 'hpa.py':
- a figure corresponding to a three-dimensional graph of the HPA data
  represented in the first three principal components.
