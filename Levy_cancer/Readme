The present directory is related to the work done 
in the paper arXiv:1507.08232, updated on July 2020.

There are two files. A txt file named 'tissues_D-data.txt'
and a python script 'cancer.py'.

The script 'cancer.py' reads data on lifetime cancer risk,
number of normal stem cells (Nsc) and annual division rate 
per stem cell (msc) for 31 different cancers. This data can 
be found in the papers https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1260825 
and https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaf9011. It is also 
available in the 'databases_external/Cancer_Risk/' section of 
this repository.

A second set of data comes from a principal component analysis (PCA) on 
gene expression data downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas 
database for eight different tissues. This includes the center 
of the tumor zone (Xt) and the rms radii along the first 
principal component (PC1) of the normal zone (Rn) and tumor 
zone (Rt). These results can be found in the paper 
arXiv:1706.09813, updated in July 2020, and the way the 
calculations are performed may be found in this repository in 
the section PCA_cancer, and the PCA results in section 
'databases_generated/TCGA_pca/'. 

A final set of data comes from the txt file 'tissues_D-data.txt',
which collects the greatest modular contribution (D) to the 
eigenvector associated to the first principal component PC1. See 
the paper arXiv:2003.07828 for further details.

Outputs for 'cancer.py'
- A data file with the values of x1, Rn, Rt, D, cancer risk and 
  its deviation, similar to Table 1 in the paper.
- A data file with the extra risk scores (ERS) for 31 different 
  tissues, see Table 2 in the paper.
- A plot of the (PC1,PC2) plane for colon adenocarcinoma, see 
  Fig.1 a) in the paper.
- A plot of the fitness distribution vs. PC1 for the same case, 
  see Fig.1 b) in the paper.
- Two plots of how Eq.6 and Eq.10 describe cancer risk of 8 
  tissues mentioned below, see Fig.3 and Fig.4 in the paper.
- A plot of cancer risk per stem cell vs. time, measured as the
  number of stem cells divisions, see Fig.5 in the paper.

The eight types of cancer where all parameters are available:
COAD - Colon adenocarcinoma
THCA - Thyroid carcinoma
LUAD - Lung adenocarcinoma
PRAD - Prostate adenocarcinoma
BRCA - Breast invasive carcinoma
LIHC - Liver hepatocellular carcinoma
HNSC - Head and Neck squamous cell carcinoma
ESCA - Esophageal carcinoma
