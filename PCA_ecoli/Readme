The present directory corresponds to the paper arXiv:1706.09813
and describes the Principal Component Analysis of the expression 
data of ancestral and evolved E. Coli populations.

The database was downloaded from the web portal of the Long Term
Evolution Experiment with E. Coli, 
http://myxo.css.msu.edu/ecoli/summdata.html, and is replicated
in the folder 'evolp/PCA_ecoli/'.

The script 'ecoli.py' makes use of the routine pca_core.py 
included in the directory 'evolp/pca_cancer/', and applies the 
PCA technique to the data.

Outputs of 'ecoli.py':
- a file with the principal components of the data
- two files with the corresponding eigenvalues and aigenvectors
- a file with a list of the main genes
- a plot of PC1
- a plot of PC1 vs. PC2 data analogous to Fig.2a in the paper
