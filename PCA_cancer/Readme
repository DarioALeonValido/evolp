The present directory corresponds to the work of Principal
Component Analys of the data downloaded of The Cancer Genome 
Atlas(TCGA).


There are two scripts: 'PCA_core.py' and 'tcga.py'.

'PCA_core.py' contains a collection of routines for 
Principal Component Analysis.

'tcga.py' applies the PCA technique to TCGA data at 
https://www.cancer.gov/tcga. In this script a lite version 
can be selected to process only some genes of the data to 
be able to test the subroutine with a low computational cost.
By default the Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma (KIRC) data 
is processed, to use with other tissues you can change the value
of the tissue_id variable by one of the following identifiers:
"PRAD" - Prostate adenocarcinoma
"KIRC" - Kidney renal clear cell carcinoma
"LUSC" - Lung squamous cell carcinoma
"LUAD" - Lung adenocarcinoma
"UCEC" - Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma
"KIRP" - Kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma
"BLCA" - Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma
"COAD" - Colon adenocarcinoma
"ESCA" - Esophageal carcinoma
"LIHC" - Liver hepatocellular carcinoma
"STAD" - Stomach adenocarcinoma
"THCA" - Thyroid carcinoma
"BRCA" - Breast invasive carcinoma
"HNSC" - Head and Neck squamous cell carcinoma
"READ" - Rectum adenocarcinoma

Outputs of 'tcga.py' for lite version:
- a data file with the principal components of the data.
- a data file with the normalized eigenvalues ​​arranged in 
descending order.
- a data file with the eigenvalues arranged in descending 
order.
- a data file with the eigenvectors, each row contains the 
eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue of the same row 
in the eigenvalue file.
- 3 data files with information about 20 components more 
significative of the first eigenvector.
- a data file with the index of the samples correspondent 
to the normal tissue. 
- a data file with the index of the samples correspondent
to the tumor tissue.
- a figure with the two first principal components.
- a figure with the 20 components more significative of the 
first eigenvector.
