The present directory corresponds to the work of principal
component analys of the data downloaded of TCGA.


There are two scripts: 'PCA_core.py' and 'tcga.py', for 
TCGA data.

'PCA_core.py' contains a collection of routines for 
Principal Component Analysis.

'tcga.py' applies the PCA technique to TCGA data at 
https://www.cancer.gov/tcga. In this script a lite version 
can be selected to process only some genes of the data to 
be able to test the subroutine with a low computational cost.

Outputs of 'tcga.py' for lite version:
- a data file with the principal components of the data.
- a data file with the normalized eigenvalues ​​arranged in 
descending order.
- a data file with the eigenvalues arranged in descending 
order.
- a data file with the eigenvectors, each row contains the 
eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue of the same row 
in the eigenvalue file.
- 3 data files with information about 20 components more 
significative of the first eigenvector.
- a data file with the index of the samples correspondent 
to the normal tissue. 
- a data file with the index of the samples correspondent
to the tumor tissue.
- a figure with the two first principal components.
- a figure with the 20 components more significative of the 
first eigenvector.

Outputs of 'tcga.py' for full version:
- a file with the principal components of the data
