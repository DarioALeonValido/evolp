This directory corresponds to the Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
of gene expression data that come from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
and Human Protein Atlas (HPA).

There are three python script 'tcga.py', for TCGA data; 'hpa.py',
for HPA data; and 'PCA_core_mem.py' that contains a PCA routine.

'tcga.py' reads TCGA data found in the 'databases_generated/tcga-hpa/'
directory at the repository root and applies the PCA technique.

'hpa.py' reads HPA data found in the 'databases_external/PCA/'
directory at the repository root and applies the PCA technique.

'PCA_core_mem.py' contains routine of PCA that makes use of the Lanczos
algorithm to avoid exceeding the maximum capacity of memory RAM using the
disk storage.

Output of 'tcga.py':
- a figure corresponding to a three-dimensional graph of the TCGA data
  represented in the first three principal components.

Outputs of 'hpa.py':
- a figure corresponding to a three-dimensional graph of the HPA data
  represented in the first three principal components.
