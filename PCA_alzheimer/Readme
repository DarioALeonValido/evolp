The present directory corresponds to the paper arXiv:1706.09813 
and describes the Principal Component Analysis of the expression 
data related to the Alzheimer disease.

The database was downloaded from the Allen Institute study on 
aging and dementia, http://aging.brain-map.org/, and is 
replicated in the folder 'evolp/bases_external/Aging_Brain/'. 

The script 'alzheimer.py' makes use of the routine pca_core.py 
included in the directory 'evolp/pca_cancer/', and applies the 
PCA technique to the specific "No Dementia" and "Alzheimer's 
Disease Type" data that correspond to one of the following 
measurement identifiers:
FWM
HIP
PCx
TCx

A bool variable controls whether we would like to performe a 
lite version with a reduced number of genes, for testing the 
subroutine, or the full version with more than 50000 genes.

Outputs of 'alzheimer.py'
- a file with the principal components of the data
- two files with the corresponding eigenvalues and aigenvectors
- a file with a list of the main genes
- a plot of PC1
- a plot of PC1 vs. PC2 data analogous to Fig.4a in the paper
